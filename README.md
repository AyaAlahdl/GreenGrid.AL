# 🌱 GreenGrid.AI

**Smart Energy Optimization using Multi-Agent Systems + AI**

GreenGrid.AI is a modular, intelligent system that helps households reduce electricity costs and optimize energy usage by leveraging solar power, real-time pricing data, and AI-powered decision making. Built with a multi-agent architecture, the system integrates forecasting, sensing, optimization, and natural language reporting to deliver actionable insights to users through a sleek web dashboard.

## 🚀 Inspiration

The increasing demand for energy efficiency, climate-conscious living, and smart home solutions inspired us to create GreenGrid.AI. We envisioned a tool that could empower people to make better energy decisions without needing to understand complex data, combining autonomous agents and artificial intelligence to do the heavy lifting.

## 💡 What It Does

GreenGrid.AI:
- Tracks energy consumption and solar generation
- Forecasts future solar output and energy usage
- Fetches live electricity prices
- Optimizes when to store, use, or sell electricity
- Presents clear recommendations via a web dashboard
- Uses LLMs (like Gemini) to explain technical insights in plain English

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Streamlit  
- **Agent Architecture:** Built using the Agent Development Kit (ADK)  
- **Cloud & Storage:** Google BigQuery  
- **APIs:** 
  - [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) – weather forecasts  
  - [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy/) – dynamic electricity pricing  
  - [Google Gemini Pro](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) – natural language reporting  
- **Other Tools:** Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn (forecasting), Prompt Engineering
